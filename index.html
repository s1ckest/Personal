    <p>his web page is a simple demonstration of my first experience with HTML and CSS. The content reflects my interest in Websites, and I aimed for a clean and minimalistic design. Using CSS, I styled the layout to include a consistent color scheme and basic responsiveness. I have no prior experience in web design, but I found this exercise useful in understanding the fundamental principles of webpage creation and aesthetics. Additionally, I chose to use GitHub Pages for hosting to practice version control and site deployment.</p>
